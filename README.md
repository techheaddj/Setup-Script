# Setup Script
This is a script that I made to simplify the deployment of new systems. I have since upgraded to https://fogproject.org/, but this still sometimes comes in handy if
the image doesn't properly get along with the SSD size. This is what I use after I do a clean install of W10 Pro. It first installs MS Office (not included for filesize and
licensing reasons). Then, using Ninite Pro https://ninite.com/pro (not included for licensing reasons): Google Backup and Sync, 7-Zip, Chrome, CutePDF, Adobe
Reader, VLC media player, Silverlight, Pidgin, Air, and Shockwave. It also sets up DesktopInfo http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/ using configuration prepared
beforehand (freeware, included). Also included are DelProf2 https://helgeklein.com/free-tools/delprof2-user-profile-deletion-tool/ and OemKey http://neosmart.net/OemKey/
which I use for cleanup and activation using the product key if it is provided on the motherboard.
